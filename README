WinPad is a utility for using a 360 gamepad to navigate Windows that I'm working on. Built on XNA for accessing gamepad.
This software is distributed under the Microsoft Public License, see Ms-Pl.txt

Uses WindowsInput for sending input. http://inputsimulator.codeplex.com/


INSTRUCTIONS:
Left-thumbstick to move the mouse cursor.
A to do left mouse button click.
X to do right mouse button click
Dpad to use arrow keys.
Left-trigger to alt-tab, then left/right on dpad to select.


ISSUES: 
Attempting to drag/minimize/close WinPad using the gamepad causes update cycle to stop, so gamepad is unusable until it is deselected.


TODO: 
Add repeating presses of arrow keys when dpad direction is held.
Remove the window and make it a system tray application.
