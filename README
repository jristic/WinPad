WinPad is a utility for using a 360 gamepad to navigate Windows that I'm working on. Built on XNA for accessing gamepad.

Uses WindowsInput for sending input. http://inputsimulator.codeplex.com/
WindowsInput used under the Microsoft Public License, see WinPad/WindowsInput/Ms-Pl.txt


ISSUES: 
Attempting to drag/minimize/close WinPad using the gamepad causes the updates to not occur, so gamepad is unusable until it is deselected.


TODO: 
Add repeating presses of arrow keys when dpad direction is held.
Smooth out mouse motion if possible.
