WinPad is a utility for using a 360 gamepad to navigate Windows that I'm working on. Built on XNA for accessing gamepad.
This software is distributed under the Microsoft Public License, see Ms-Pl.txt

Uses WindowsInput for sending input. http://inputsimulator.codeplex.com/


INSTRUCTIONS:
Left-thumbstick to move the mouse cursor.
A to do left mouse button click.
X to do right mouse button click
Dpad to use arrow keys.
Right-trigger to scroll.
Left-trigger to alt-tab, then left/right on dpad or up/down on right-thumbstick to select.


ISSUES: 
Attempting to drag/minimize/close WinPad using the gamepad causes update cycle to stop, so gamepad is unusable until it is deselected. (It can however be closed from the taskbar using the gamepad)
When the User Account Control dialog comes up, the program is suspended so the gamepad is unusable until it is gone.

TODO: 
Add repeating presses of arrow keys when dpad direction is held.
Remove the window and make it a system tray application.
